       [1msudo -i[0m

[1mINTRODUCTION[0m
       By default, the password for the user "root" (the system administrator) is locked. This means you cannot login as root or use su. Instead, the installer
       will set up sudo to allow the user that is created during install to run all administrative commands.

       This means that in the terminal you can use sudo for commands that require root privileges. All programs in the menu will use a graphical sudo to prompt
       for a password. When sudo asks for a password, it needs [1myour password, [22mthis means that a root password is not needed.

       To run a command which requires root privileges in a terminal, simply prepend [1msudo [22min front of it. To get an interactive root shell, use [1msudo -i[22m.

[1mALLOWING OTHER USERS TO RUN SUDO[0m
       By  default,  only the user who installed the system is permitted to run sudo. To add more administrators, i. e. users who can run sudo, you have to add
       these users to the group 'sudo' by doing one of the following steps:

       * In a shell, do

           [1msudo adduser [4m[22musername[24m [1msudo[0m

       * Use the graphical "Users & Groups" program in the "System settings" menu to add the new user to the [1msudo [22mgroup.

[1mBENEFITS OF USING SUDO[0m
       The benefits of leaving root disabled by default include the following:

       * Users do not have to remember an extra password, which they are likely to forget.

       * The installer is able to ask fewer questions.

       * It avoids the "I can do anything" interactive login by default - you will be prompted for a password before major changes  can  happen,  which  should
         make you think about the consequences of what you are doing.

       * Sudo adds a log entry of the command(s) run (in [1m/var/log/auth.log[22m).

       * Every  attacker trying to brute-force their way into your box will know it has an account named root and will try that first. What they do not know is
         what the usernames of your other users are.

       * Allows easy transfer for admin rights, in a short term or long term period, by adding and removing users from the sudo group, while  not  compromising
         the root account.

       * sudo can be set up with a much more fine-grained security policy.

       * On systems with more than one administrator using sudo avoids sharing a password amongst them.

[1mDOWNSIDES OF USING SUDO[0m
       Although for desktops the benefits of using sudo are great, there are possible issues which need to be noted:

       * Redirecting the output of commands run with sudo can be confusing at first. For instance consider

           [1msudo ls > /root/somefile[0m

         will not work since it is the shell that tries to write to that file. You can use

           [1mls | sudo tee /root/somefile[0m

         to get the behaviour you want.

       * In  a lot of office environments the ONLY local user on a system is root. All other users are imported using NSS techniques such as nss-ldap. To setup
         a workstation, or fix it, in the case of a network failure where nss-ldap is broken, root is required. This tends to leave the system unusable. An ex‚Äê
         tra local user, or an enabled root password is needed here.

[1mGOING BACK TO A TRADITIONAL ROOT ACCOUNT[0m
       [1mThis is not recommended![0m

       To enable the root account (i.e. set a password) use:

           [1msudo passwd root[0m

       Afterwards, edit the sudo configuration with [1msudo visudo [22mand comment out the line

           %sudo  ALL=(ALL) ALL

       to disable sudo access to members of the sudo group.
